This repository contains:
* __`scripts.ipynb`__: a Jupyter Notebook that contains all the python scripts for the exercises. Every code cell is a single exercise. 
    - The Notebook is divided in two main sections:
        - **Problem 1** provides all the exercises for the first problem of Homework1 grouped by argument
        - **Problem 2** contains all the challenges for the second problem of Homework1  
* __`stamps/submissions.pdf`__: is a PDF with all the screenshots of the submissions that I made on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
